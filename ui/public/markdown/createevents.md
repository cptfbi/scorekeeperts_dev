# Creating New Events

Admin &#x21D2; New Events.

Rather than enter the same data over and over, events are created from a common template and you can change special details of each event after.

![CreateEvent](/images/createevent.png){ .three4 }

1. Click on the green plus sign to add new event names to the creation process.  For each entry you enter the event name, event date and event location.

2. Set the details on when to open and close registration for each event.  You select how many days before the event to open registration and then the day of week and time to close.  If you want to open all events right away, just enter a large number like 365.

3. Below that, you can adjust the normal event settings such as payment accounts, items, entry limits, etc.  All of those settings will be copied to each created event verbatim.

The **Create Events** button will be at the bottom.
